                    In an alternate present day, humans, orcs, elves and fairies have been coexisting since the beginning of time. 
                    Two police officers, one a human, the other an orc, embark on a routine night patrol that will alter the future of their world as they know it. 
                    Battling both their own personal differences as well as an onslaught of enemies, they must work together to protect a young female elf and a thought-to-be-forgotten relic, which, in the wrong hands, could destroy everything.

                <h1>Tomb Raider</h1>
                <p>
                    Lara Croft is the fiercely independent daughter of an eccentric adventurer who vanished years earlier. 
                    Hoping to solve the mystery of her father's disappearance, Croft embarks on a perilous journey to his last-known destination -- a fabled tomb on a mythical island that might be somewhere off the coast of Japan. 
                    The stakes couldn't be higher as Lara must rely on her sharp mind, blind faith and stubborn spirit to venture into the unknown.
